        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This is my great-grandmother's recipe that she passed down to me, and it is quite simply the best chocolate dessert I have ever had. It's so simple and so yummy! Beware--if you bring this to a party it will go fast!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 cup butter, melted</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>Â½ cup buttermilk</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 11x17 jelly roll pan.</li>
            <li>Mix white sugar and flour in a large bowl. Combine 1 cup butter, water, and 3 tablespoons cocoa powder in a small saucepan; stir over medium heat until butter is melted and mixture is well combined. Pour melted butter mixture over sugar and flour; beat well. Beat in baking soda, buttermilk, eggs, and vanilla extract. Pour batter into prepared pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of cake comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool on a wire rack.</li>
        </ol>
